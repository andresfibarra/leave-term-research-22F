# 22F Leave Term Research

Made with guidance by Dartmouth Professor Bo Zhu as part of Fall 22 Leave Term Research in the Computer Science Department

The code in this repository, written in Jupyter Notebooks, uses [Taichi Lang](https://www.taichi-lang.org/), a high performance parallel programming language embedded in Python, to run various simulations. This term, programs were written to simulate:
- a mass spring system using an explicit Euler integration scheme
- a mass spring system using an implicit Euler integration scheme
- particle sand 
- particle fluids
- grid fluids

To run this code, download the chosen Jupyter Notebook, download Taichi on your computer by typing `pip install taichi -U` in the command line, and run the cells. The simulation will appear in a separate window.
